## Basics of IR Systems

From the above diagram, it is clear that a user who needs information will have to formulate a request in the form of a query in natural language. After that, the IR system will return output by retrieving the relevant output, in the form of documents, about the required information.

The step by step procedure of these systems are as follows:

- Indexing the collection of documents.

- Transforming the query in the same way as the document content is represented.

- Comparing the description of each document with that of the query.

- Listing the results in order of relevancy.

### Retrieval Systems consist of mainly two processes:

- Indexing

- Matching

## Indexing
It is the process of selecting terms to represent a text.

The common Indexing Techniques: ***Vector space model***
Vector space model or term vector model is an algebraic model for representing text documents (and any objects, in general) as [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) of identifiers (such as index terms).

Each dimension corresponds to a separate term. If a term occurs in the document, its value in the vector is non-zero. Several different ways of computing these values, also known as (term) weights, have been developed. One of the best known schemes is tf-idf weighting

Vector operations can be used to compare documents with queries.

The model is known as term frequency-inverse document frequency model.

### ***Term frequency***

The weight of a term that occurs in a document is simply proportional to the term frequency.

### ***Inverse document frequency***

The specificity of a term can be quantified as an inverse function of the number of documents in which it occurs.

The ***tfâ€“idf*** is the product of two statistics, term frequency and inverse document frequency. There are various ways for determining the exact values of both statistics.

For more info check tf-idf in [wiki-pedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf).


### Data cleanning

1. Rmoving white spaces
2. Removing punctuation
3. Replace bruckets whith white space
4. Tokenization of string
5. Removing frequent words
6. Removing stop wrods
7. Formatting multi-form names to one form
8. detecting and formatting dates
9. Stemming
